# Surfer-Boy
Game very similar to Cube Surfer! in gameplay.


I created a very simple Box Surfer-like runner, you have to stack white boxes and have to make it over red walls, when the boxes hit a wall they are removed from the stack, making it shorter. If at any time the player hits the walls it’s Game Over.

The goal is to make it to the end of each stage.

The game loads levels by instancing tiles from the Game Manager (or Level Builder, if the mode is selected). The level layouts are stored in a Scriptable Object of type Level Sequence. These sequences were generated by the game but can also be edited/sequenced manually.

The game includes 3 modes:

-Original: Where the player can progress through an assortment of pre-generated levels.

-Random: Where the player can play a randomly generated level each time the mode is loaded. This mode tracks your high score, you get 1 point for each box you have in your stack when you reach the goal.

-Level Builder: Where the player can build and play a straight level using an assortment of 5 tiles to do so.

There is a save feature that tracks the progress you’ve made in the Original mode and your high core in Random mode.


//ADDITIONAL NOTES//

-I used the LeanTween Library to create the Button Effects and the Player Flip effect.

-The game was developed on Unity Version 2020.3.0f1.
